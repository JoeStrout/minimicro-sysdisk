englishWords.txt
================
The "englishWords.txt" file derived from the "12dicts" package 
(http://wordlist.aspell.net/12dicts/) by Alan Beale.  It is 
essentially the file in that package called 3of6game.txt, and is
a collection designed to be particularly useful for word games. 
It contains 64,662 English words, from "a" to "zygotes".

The original file had additional characters (^, &, $, +, or !) 
appended to some words to denote word type or origin.  These 
annotations have been removed in the englishWords.txt file, for 
simplicity of use.  Of course you can go download the original 
package if you find you have use for them.

If you publish a program using this data, please add a credit 
along the lines of:
